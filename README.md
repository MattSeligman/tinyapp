# TinyApp
Tinyapp is a web app that leverages Node.js, letting users create short URLs. It's much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly, but with a few minor differences.

Features:
View, and create Tiny URLs, Session Control with Cookies.

## Benefits: 
Create Tiny URL's with ease along with redirect to them when sharing the link. (If hosted)
